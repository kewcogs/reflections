When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- to make repository available to other users/collaborators.
- keep copy of repository in cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Changes by other collaborators may conflict with what you are doing
