When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- to make repository available to other users/collaborators.
- keep copy of repository in cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Changes by other collaborators may conflict with what you are doing

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Branches exist within an existing repository
- Clone creates a copy of a repository. The two repositories are seperate.
- Fork is a clone of a repository within GitHub. It keeps a record of which repositories were forked and from where.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- Can access remote files when off-line
- Can diff with local copy
