What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- .git directory created
- creates all the neccessay files which make up a repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- Staging area represents uncommitted changes.
- Working directory may contain files which are not to be part of the repository, and files which are not yet added to the repository.
- The repository itself only contains committed files.
- By having a staging area it is possible to collect changes together as a unit-of-work for committing together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- Only "git add" those files which constitute a single logical change before committing
